  <h1>Myntra Clone Project</h1>
  <p>


This project is a basic clone of the Myntra website, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of this project is to replicate the user interface (UI) of Myntra, providing a similar visual experience and basic functionality. Here's a brief overview of the features and components included:

Homepage: The homepage features a clean and responsive layout with a header, main content area, and footer. The header includes a navigation bar with links to various sections such as Men, Women, Kids, and Home & Living.

Product Listings: Product listing pages showcase various products in a grid format. Each product card displays an image, name, price, and a short description. Hover effects and animations enhance the user experience.

Product Detail Page: Clicking on a product takes the user to a detailed product page that includes a larger image, detailed description, price, size options, and an Add to Cart button.

Cart Functionality: Users can add products to their cart, view their selected items, and see the total price. Basic JavaScript functionality allows for item addition and removal from the cart.

Responsive Design: The UI is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Interactive Elements: JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the UI, such as dynamic content updates, form validations, and simple animations.

Overall, this project demonstrates a solid understanding of front-end web development concepts and provides a foundation for building more complex e-commerce applications.
